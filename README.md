# Search1API MCP Server

[中文文档](./README_zh.md)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides search and crawl functionality using Search1API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- A valid Search1API API key (See **Setup Guide** below on how to obtain and configure)

## Installation (Standalone / General)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mystique920/search1api-mcp.git
    cd search1api-mcp
    ```

2.  **Configure API Key:** Before building, you need to provide your Search1API key. See the **Setup Guide** section below for different methods (e.g., using a `.env` file or environment variables).

3.  **Install dependencies and build:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    *Note: If using the project's `.env` file method for the API key, ensure it exists before this step.*

## Usage (Standalone / General)

Ensure your API key is configured (see **Setup Guide**).

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will then be ready to accept connections from MCP clients.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Get Search1API Key

1.  Register at [Search1API](https://www.search1api.com/?utm_source=mcp)
2.  Get your API key from your dashboard.

### 2. Configure API Key

You need to make your API key available to the server. Choose **one** of the following methods:

**Method A: Project `.env` File (Recommended for Standalone or LibreChat)**

This method is required if integrating with the current version of LibreChat (see specific section below).

1.  In the `search1api-mcp` project root directory, create a file named `.env`:
    ```bash
    # In the search1api-mcp directory
    echo "SEARCH1API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
    ```
2.  Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key.
3.  Make sure this file exists **before** running `npm install && npm run build`.

**Method B: Environment Variable (Standalone Only)**

Set the `SEARCH1API_KEY` environment variable before starting the server.

```bash
export SEARCH1API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
npm start
```

**Method C: MCP Client Configuration (Advanced)**

Some MCP clients allow specifying environment variables directly in their configuration. This is useful for clients like Cursor, VS Code extensions, etc.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "search1api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "search1api-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SEARCH1API_KEY": "YOUR_SEARCH1API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note for LibreChat Users:** Due to current limitations in LibreChat, Method A (Project `.env` File) is the **required** method. See the dedicated integration section below for full instructions.

## Integration with LibreChat (Docker)

This section details the required steps for integrating with LibreChat via Docker.

**Overview:**

1.  Clone this server's repository into a location accessible by your LibreChat `docker-compose.yml`.
2.  Configure the required API key using the **Project `.env` File method** within this server's directory.
3.  Build this server.
4.  Tell LibreChat how to run this server by editing `librechat.yaml`.
5.  Make sure the built server code is available inside the LibreChat container via a Docker volume bind.
6.  Restart LibreChat.

**Step-by-Step:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to the directory on your host machine where you manage external services for LibreChat (this is often alongside your `docker-compose.yml`). A common location is a dedicated `mcp-server` directory.
    ```bash
    # Example: Navigate to where docker-compose.yml lives, then into mcp-server
    cd /path/to/your/librechat/setup/mcp-server
    git clone https://github.com/mystique920/search1api-mcp.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the Server Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd search1api-mcp
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key (Project `.env` File Method - Required for LibreChat):**
    ```bash
    # Create the .env file
    echo "SEARCH1API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
    # IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual Search1API key
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies and Build:**
    This step compiles the server code into the `build` directory.
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Configure `librechat.yaml`:**
    Edit your main `librechat.yaml` file to tell LibreChat how to execute this MCP server. Add an entry under `mcp_servers`:
    ```yaml
    # In your main librechat.yaml
    mcp_servers:
      # You can add other MCP servers here too
      search1api:
        # Optional: Display name for the server in LibreChat UI
        # name: Search1API Tools

        # Command tells LibreChat to use 'node'
        command: node

        # Args specify the script for 'node' to run *inside the container*
        args:
          - /app/mcp-server/search1api-mcp/build/index.js
    ```
    *   The `args` path (`/app/...`) is the location *inside* the LibreChat API container where the built server will be accessed (thanks to the volume bind in the next step).

6.  **Configure Docker Volume Bind:**
    Edit your `docker-compose.yml` (or more likely, your `docker-compose.override.yml`) to map the `search1api-mcp` directory from your host machine into the LibreChat API container. Find the `volumes:` section for the `api:` service:
    ```yaml
    # In your docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.override.yml
    services:
      api:
        # ... other service config ...
        volumes:
          # ... other volumes likely exist here ...

          # Add this volume bind:
          - ./mcp-server/search1api-mcp:/app/mcp-server/search1api-mcp
    ```
    *   **Host Path (`./mcp-server/search1api-mcp`):** This is the path on your host machine *relative* to where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Adjust it if you cloned the repo elsewhere.
    *   **Container Path (`:/app/mcp-server/search1api-mcp`):** This is the path *inside* the container. It **must match** the directory structure used in the `librechat.yaml` `args` path.

7.  **Restart LibreChat:**
    Apply the changes by rebuilding (if you modified `docker-compose.yml`) and restarting your LibreChat stack.
    ```bash
    docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
    # Or: docker compose restart api (if only librechat.yaml changed)
    ```

Now, the Search1API server should be available as a tool provider within LibreChat.
