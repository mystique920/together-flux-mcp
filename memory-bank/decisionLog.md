## Decision

*   [2025-04-10 16:06:50] - Refactor the existing MCP server codebase (originally for Search1API) to focus exclusively on Together AI image generation.

## Rationale 

*   The original project structure provided a good foundation for an MCP server.
*   The goal shifted to creating a dedicated server for a single, specific API (Together AI Image Generation).
*   Reusing the existing API key loading and request-making patterns (`src/config.ts`, `src/api.ts`) saves development time and maintains consistency, requiring only adaptation for the new API key (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`) and endpoints.

## Implementation Details

*   Modified `src/config.ts` to use `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, update base URL, and define the `IMAGE_GENERATION` endpoint.
*   Verified `src/api.ts` correctly uses the updated config and key.
*   Created `src/tools/image_generation.ts` with the specific tool logic.
*   Removed old tool files and updated `src/tools/index.ts` and `src/server.ts` to integrate only the new tool.
*   Updated documentation (`README.md`, Memory Bank files) to reflect the change.
